<p><b>The Ebb and Flow of Deep Learning: a Theory of Local Learning</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract</b> 
In a physical neural system, where storage and processing are intertwined, the learning rules for adjusting synaptic weights can only depend on local variables, such as the activity of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Thus learning models must specify
two things: (1) which variables are to be considered local; and (2) which kind of function combines these local variables into a learning rule. We consider polynomial learning rules and analyze their behavior
and capabilities in both linear and non-linear networks. As a byproduct, this framework enables the discovery of new learning rules and important relationships between learning rules and group symmetries.

<p>
Stacking local learning rules in deep feedforward networks leads to deep local learning. While deep local learning can learn interesting representations, it cannot learn complex input-output functions, even when targets are available for the top layer. Learning complex input-output functions
requires instead local deep learning, where target information is transmitted to the deep layers, thereby raising two fundamental issues: (1) the nature of the transmission channel; and (2)
the nature and amount of information transmitted over this channel. This leads to the class of deep targets learning algorithms, which provide targets for the deep layers, and its stratification along the information spectrum,
illuminating the remarkable power and uniqueness of the backpropation algorithm. The theory clarifies the concept of Hebbian learning, what is learnable by Hebbian learning, and explains the sparsity of the space of learning rules discovered so far and the unique role
backpropagation plays in this space.

<p><b>How Deep Learning Transforms Chinese Internet Search</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract</b> 
Since 2012, the Chinese internet giant Baidu has launched a significant effort to develop deep learning technologies to transform its search engine to the next stage. The company established  Institute of Deep Learning (IDL), the first research team of Baidu and later expanded the research force to a bigger organization Baidu Research. By leveraging big data and massive parallel computation on CPU and GPU servers, Baidu researchers have achieved transformative improvements to Baidu's core business, such as web search, online advertising, speech recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, smart data center, robotics, etc.. In this talk I will showcase some of the highlights, and introduce the underlying technologies. These technologies have been shaping up a foundation for imaginative long-term innovation of Baidu. In the end I will discuss some thoughts about the future directions of deep learning.

<p>
<b>Bio</b>
Dr. Kai YU is the Deputy Managing Director of Baidu Research, the Head of Baidu Institute of Deep Learning (IDL), and a Senior Engineering Director of Baidu. In 2013 and 2014, his team has won 3 Highest Achievement Awards of Baidu, for significant contributions to speech recognition, computer vision, online ads, and web search ranking.  Dr. Yu is elected to China "Top 1000 Talents", a prestigious group of technology leaders of the country. Dr. Yu has published a number of papers in NIPS, ICML, AISTAT, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, SIGIR, SIGKDD, etc., with more than 8000 citations. He and his colleagues have received many awards including the Best Paper Runner-up Award of ICML-2013, the First Place of PASCAL VOC 2009, and the First Place of ImageNet Challenge 2010. He is an Adjunct Professor of Nanjing University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before joining Baidu, he worked at Microsoft, Siemens, NEC Labs America, and was an Adjunct Faculty at Department of Computer Sciences at Stanford University, teaching "CS121: Introduction to AI". He received his B.Sc and M.Sc degrees from Nanjing University, China, and his Ph.D. degree from University of Munich, Germany.

<p><b>Data and/as Journalism</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract</b> 
As statisticians know well, data and data technologies have profound 
social and political relevance -- almost every aspect of our lives can 
"rendered" in data. These data tell us stories about who we are and 
how we live, but, as products of human attention, innovation and 
memory, their perspective is not neutral and the stories they tell are 
often incomplete, open-ended and biased.

Data can either reinforce or challenge systems of power and so, in a 
very real sense, our democracy depends on the public being able to 
think critically about these technologies, telling the good stories 
from the bad. As "truth-tellers, sense-makers and explainers of last 
resort," to quote my colleague Emily Bell, journalists needs to 
understand the working of data in society, and the ways in which data, 
code and algorithms function.

In this talk, I will look at how journalism is adapting to a world of 
"Big Data" and "Data Science." From a pedagogical perspective, 
journalism acts as a kind of "integrator" of real world problems with 
more technical statistical and computational perspectives. The 
practice of journalism fills a gap between lived experience and data, 
its analysis and its visualization -- and might	even expand the way we 
teach statistics.

<p><b>Scaling Machine Learning and Statistics for Web Applications</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract</b> 
Scaling web applications like recommendation systems, search and computational advertising is challenging. Such systems have to make astronomical number of decisions every day on what to serve users when they are using the website and/or the mobile app. Machine learning and statistical modeling approaches that can obtain insights by continuously processing large amounts of data emitted at very high frequency by these applications have emerged as the method of choice. However, there are three challenges to scale such methods :  a) scientific  b)infrastructure and c) organizational.  I will provide an overview of these challenges and the strategies we have adopted at LinkedIn to address those. Throughout, I will illustrate with examples from real-world applications at LinkedIn.
